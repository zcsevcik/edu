For over a decade we have been developing a broad-coverage,
domain general natural language parsing system. While it has been constructed
in a application-driven manner, with extensions motivated by particular
problems in practice, the grammar and lexicon are all designed to be
domain-general. We have only one grammar and lexicon that is used is all our
different applications. As a result, when we start a new project, we already
have a sophisticated language processing system in place at the start of the
project, and have no need to collect and anotate corpora in order to get a high
performance system. The parser produces a rich semantic representation of
sentences suitable for discourse reasonin such as reference resolution and
intention recognition. The parser produces logical forms using a generic ontology
(the LF ontology) and we have a set of ontology-mapping tools that allows us to
map to the target ontology/representation of each application. Feel free to try
out "the TRIPS Parser". The basic ideas
underlying the grammar and parser are best described in my book "Natural Language Understanding, 2nd edition".
Specific details on the actual system, its uses and evaluations, are found in
the references below.

The research in plan reasoning draws much of its motivation
from the dialog work. In particular, the representation of plans must support a
wide range of different forms of reasoning: plan construction (i.e. traditional
planning), plan recognition, plan evaluation, and the communication of plans
between agents. Much of our work in this area has focused on the representation
of time and action, and we have reformulated the planning problem as a problem
in temporal reasoning. Within this framework, we have developed a
representation of plans that is temporally explicit and supports plan
construction, recognition and communication. We are also exploring methods of
temporal reasoning that are viable even with large data sets of temporal
information.
